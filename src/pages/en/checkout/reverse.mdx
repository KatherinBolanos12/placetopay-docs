# Reverse
You can revert previously approved transactions using an internal reference provided in the response [query a session](/en/checkout/api-reference/session#query-a-session), in the `payment.internalReference` property.

## Create a transfer reversal
To reverse a transaction, you must make a request on the [Reverse](/checkout/api-reference/payment#reverse-payment) endpoint and specify the transaction to be refunded.
When you reverse transactions,you have the option to reverse a partial amount of the transaction. You can do this as many times as necessary until the full amount of the initially approved transaction has been reversed.

Once a transaction has been fully refunded, it cannot be refunded again. This method will return an error `status.status.message` `Transaction already reversed` if an attempt is made to reverse an already fully reversed transaction, or if an attempt is made to reverse more money than is left in the transaction.

## Query a reversed transaction
To verify a reversed transaction, the session of the reversed transaction must be [consulted](/en/checkout/api-reference/session#query-a-session).

You will find in the response the `payment.refunded` property set to `true` which indicates that the transaction was successfully reversed.
