# Amounts and currencies

The amount to be charged may have some additional parameters and conditions that we must take into account.

## Decimal amounts {{ id: 'decimal-amounts' }}

When creating a payment session, Checkout uses the [ISO 4217](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) to perform validations and storage of the amounts to be paid.

If the data is a monetary amount and contains decimals, the indicated value will be rounded based on ISO 4217 and subsequently stored.

| Currency | Input       | Amount stored | Description                        |
|--------|-------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| USD    | `576.12345` | `576.12`         | Two decimal places, round down  |
| USD    | `576.9875`  | `576.99`         | Two decimal places, round up  |
| CLP    | `576.12345` | `576`            | Zero decimal places, round down |
| CLP    | `576.9875`  | `577`            | Zero decimal places, round up |
| COP    | `576.12345` | `576.12`         | Two decimal places, round down  |
| COP    | `576.9875`  | `576.99`         | Two decimal places, round up  |

### Payment session with dispersion

For sessions with dispersion, care must be taken with the decimals and the sum of the transactions to "divide".

The sum of all transactions must match the total amount of the payment session, for this the following is done:

1. Each of the dispersion values is rounded based on ISO 4217.
2. A sum of the previously rounded values is made..
3. The sum of the spread is compared with the rounded `payment.amount.total`, if the sum is correct, the session will be created successfully.

## Amount taxes {{ id: 'amount-taxes' }}

Taxes are the taxes that people or companies must pay to some entity or organization.

Depending on the activity on which it falls, one tax or another is applied. They present variation in the amount that the interested party must pay. This is based on the regulations presented by each tax system.

Checkout supports the **definition** of some of these taxes so that they can be included in the payment session.

The `amount.taxes.[].kind` value represents the type of tax that is included in the payment, the options are:


| Kind              | Traduction         | Country            |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `valueAddedTax`   | IVA                | Global             |
| `exciseDuty`      | Tax                | Global             |
| `ice`             | ICE                | Global             |
| `airportTax`      | Airport tax | Colombia y Ecuador |
| `stateTax`        | IVU state        | Puerto Rico        |
| `municipalTax`    | IVU municipal      | Puerto Rico        |
| `reducedStateTax` | IVU reduced       | Puerto Rico        |


<Note>
    When the `kind` is misspelled or does not exist in the list of tax types, the data is ignored and the `tax` is not included in the Checkout session
</Note>

### Tax structure

Taxes can be included within the `amount` structure in the `taxes` attribute which carries an array of objects

```json {{ 'title': 'Tax - Amount with Taxes' }}
{
  "payment": {
    "amount": {
      "currency": "COP",
      "total": 10000,
      "taxes": [
        {
          "kind": "valueAddedTax",
          "amount": 1000,
          "base": 0
        },
        {
          "kind": "ice",
          "amount": 1500,
          "base": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Amount details {{ id: 'amount-details' }}

The details of the amount are additional data that a payment can commonly have.

It is used to give more information about the charge made and can be shown to the user in the Checkout process..

The `amount.details.[].kind` value represents the type of detail that is included in the payment, the options are:


| Kind                | Traduction      |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `discount`          | Discount        |
| `additional`        | Additional      |

### Details structure

The details of the amount are inside the `amount` structure in the `details` attribute that carries an array of objects

### Example

```json {{ 'title': 'Detail - Amount with Details' }}
{
  "payment": {
    "amount": {
      "currency": "COP",
      "total": 10000,
      "details": [
        {
          "kind": "tip",
          "amount": 1000
        },
        {
          "kind": "interests",
          "amount": 1500
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
    The use of taxes or details in partial payment or dispersion sessions is not allowed, since these cannot be divided into different transactions
