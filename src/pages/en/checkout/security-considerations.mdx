  'Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) for Webcheckout requires considering the necessary domains for the correct functioning of the system.'

# Content Security Policy (CSP)

If you implement a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) in your application, it is essential to allow the domains used by Webcheckout to ensure proper operation of the payment gateway.

If you declare only a [default-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/default-src), this directive will act as the default value for all other missing directives. Therefore, it is important to explicitly add the domains used by Webcheckout.

## Used Domains

During session processing, the following domains must be included in your CSP configuration:

| Domains                         |
|---------------------------------|
| `https://your-domain.com`       |
| `https://3dss.placetopay.com/`  |

<Note> The domain list may be updated at any time. It is important to review and update your CSP regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest Webcheckout requirements. </Note>

## CSP Configuration Example
```json
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://3dss.placetopay.com; connect-src 'self' https://your-domain.com https://3dss.placetopay.com; img-src 'self' https://your-domain.com https://3dss.placetopay.com; frame-src https://3dss.placetopay.com;
```
