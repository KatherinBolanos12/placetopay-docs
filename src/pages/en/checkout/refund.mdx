# Refund {{ id: 'refunds' }}

From our API, you can process refunds and cancellations of approved transactions.

To process a refund, you need to know the internal reference of the transaction to be refunded, `payment.internalReference`. This information can be obtained by [Query a session](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#query-a-session).

## How to make a refund? {{ id: 'how-to-make-a-refund' }}

To process a refund, you need to make a request to the [Refund Transaction](/en/checkout/api/reference/payment#reverse-payment) endpoint. There are two types of refunds: *full* or *partial*:

### Full Refund

It is used to refund the entire approved amount of the transaction.

If the transaction has not been settled in the bank network, the refund will be treated as a "cancellation" of the transaction.

### Partial Refund

It is used to refund a portion of the approved transaction amount.

You must include the `amount` property in the request, corresponding to the amount you wish to refund.

Partial refunds can be made as many times as necessary until the total approved amount of the transaction has been refunded. Once a transaction has been fully refunded, no further refunds can be processed.

If a refund request is made for a transaction that has already been fully refunded, this method will return an error `status.message` `Transaction already refunded`.

If the transaction has not been settled in the bank network, partial refunds cannot be made; a full refund must be processed instead.

<Note>
    The availability of refunds and partial refunds may vary depending on the payment method, country, and/or provider used.
    The settlement date of transactions may vary depending on the payment method, country, and/or provider used.

## Verify a refunded transaction {{ id: 'verify-a-refund' }}

To verify whether a transaction has been fully or partially refunded, you need to [query the session](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#query-a-session) of the original transaction, where you will find the `payment.refunded` property with a value of `true` in the response.
