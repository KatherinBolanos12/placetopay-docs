# Reverse {{ id: 'reverse' }}
You can process refunds for previously approved transactions using the internal reference `payment.internalReference`, which is provided in the response when [query a session](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#query-a-session).

## How to process a reverse?
To process a reverse, you need to make a request to the [Reverse](/checkout/api/reference/payment#reverse-payment) endpoint. There are two types of refunds: full or partial.

- **Full Reverse** : 
The entire amount of the approved transaction is reversed.

- **Partial Reverse** : 
Only a portion of the total amount of the approved transaction is reversed. To perform partial reverse, the `amount` property must be included in the request. Partial reverse can be made as many times as necessary until the total amount of the transaction has been reversed.  
Once a transaction has been fully refunded, no further refunds can be made. If a refund request is made for a transaction that has been fully refunded, this method will return an error  
`status.status.message` `Transaction already reversed`.

<Note>
    A partial refund is only processed if the transaction has already been settled in the bank network.

## Verify a refunded transaction
To verify whether a transaction has been fully or partially refunded, you need to query the original transaction session, where you will find the `payment.refunded` property with a value of `true` in the response.
