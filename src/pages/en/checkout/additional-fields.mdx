   'The fields property is a structure used to relate products or items in the process. May contain multiple NameValuePair objects that represent different data to be appended in the process.'

# Additional fields

The `fields` property is used to store structured data that can be displayed in the Checkout interface based on specified conditions.. {{ className: "leading" }}

For example, it is possible to store your system's own information, such as the order ID `cmsOrderId` or the ID of the user who is performing the payment process `cmsUserId`.

The `fields` property is made up of a set of objects of the type [NameValuePair](#name-value-pair) where the data to be stored is defined.

The data to be saved can be sent in structures like:

- `redirectRequest.fields`
- `redirectRequest.payment.fields`
- `redirectRequest.subscription.fields`

## Conditions

- Up to 50 additional fields can be added. Fields in `redirectRequest.fields` will be validated first, and the remainder will be assigned to `redirectRequest.payment.fields` or `redirectRequest.subscription.fields`.
- A maximum of 255 characters is allowed in the `value` property.
- A maximum of 50 characters is allowed in the `keyword` property.
- When you send multiple `fields` with the same `keyword`, our API chooses the first one to store and display in the frontend.

<Note>
Data with property `display: both, receipt, payment, approved`, will be displayed in some interface flow.
</Note>

## NameValuePair {{ id: "name-value-pair" }}

Structure to allow relevant information to be related and control when it will be displayed in the collection process.

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties>
            <Property name="keyword" type="string" isRequired={true}>
                Identifier or index of the data to be attached.<br/>
                e.g.: `cmsInvoiceId`
            </Property>
            <Property name="value" type="string|object|array|boolean|number" isRequired={false}>
                Value of the data to be attached.<br/>
                e.g.: `ID_2233`
            </Property>
            <Property name="displayOn" type="string" isRequired={false}>
                Indicates under what conditions the attached data is displayed.<br/>
                You can use this to decide if you want certain data to be seen during data capture, in the output of the process, in both stages, or never..<br/>

        ```json {{ 'title': 'NameValuePair' }}
        {
            "keyword": "cmsInvoiceId",
            "value": "string",
            "displayOn": "both"
        }
        ```
    </Col>
</Row>

### `value` property

If no value is specified for the `value` property, its default value will be `null`

The `value` property allows you to store different types of data. However, to improve the user experience in the interface, only the values that can be presented in an understandable way will be displayed.

**Examples**

| Value                                             | Displayed as                 |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `true`                                            | true                         |
| `0`                                               | 0                            |
| `1234`                                            | 1234                         |
| `string`                                          | string                       |
| `"''"`                                            | ''                           |
| `""`                                              |                              |
| `{"key1":"value1"}`                               | It is not displayed on the interface |
| `{"key1":{"key1":"value1"}}`                      | It is not displayed on the interface |
| `["string1"]`                                     | string1                      |
| `["string1","string2"]`                           | string1, string2             |
| `[{"key1":"value1"},{"key2":"value2"}]`           | It is not displayed on the interface |
| `[{"key1":"value1"},"string1",["key1","value1"]]` | string1                      |


### `displayOn` property

If no value is specified for the `displayOn` property, its default value will be `none`

| Value       | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`      | It is not shown in any view of the collection process. This option is ideal if you want to keep this data hidden throughout the process.                             |
| `both`      | It is shown in all views of the collection process.                                                                                                                  |
| `payment`   | It is displayed only in the information capture view. If you want users to see this data while entering data, choose this option.                                    |
| `receipt`   | It is shown only in the collection result view. This option is perfect for displaying information specifically at the final stage of the collection process.         |
| `approved`  | It is shown in the collection result view only if the collection was successful.                                                                                     |

## Additional Data for Processing by Rest Services

In addition to the extra fields in `request.fields`, there are other additional data fields added during the transaction processing by Rest, and these data are found in `payment.processorFields`.

                /// ...
            ],
            // ...
        }
    ],
}
```

These same data have the same structure as [NameValuePair](#name-value-pair), and these are those in [Additional Gateway Data](/gateway/additional-data).

In addition to these data, there are others like:

Key                 | Example                                               | Description
