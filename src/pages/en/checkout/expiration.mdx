   'The expiration property is used to define the period during which a session can be processed'

# Expiration Date
When the `expiration` property is sent during session creation, it defines the deadline by which a session must be completed. The user must finish the process before this date is reached.

- **Required Format**: The expiration property must be a string in a valid timestamp format according to the `ISO 8601` standard.   
Example: 2023-07-17T13:12:44-05:00.
- **Minimum Time**: The date and time specified in expiration must be at least **5 minutes** after the session is created.

<Note> 
The `expiration` property is optional. If not provided, the system will automatically assign a default expiration time of **30 minutes** from the session creation.
