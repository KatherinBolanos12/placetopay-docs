# How Checkout works

Checkout allows you to receive payments online making a very simple integration from your site or application.

## Lifecycle {{ id: "checkout-lifecycle" }}

1. When your users are ready to complete the checkout process, your app should create a `CheckoutSession`.
2. Redirect the user to the URL provided, this URL contains our Checkout with all its functionalities ready.
3. The user enters the required data to complete the payment.
4. The user is redirected back to the merchant site.
5. After the transaction, a notification is sent so that the application knows the status of the payment.

To use PlacetoPay Checkout, you need to do a code integration using HTTP services, where your app or online store will redirect users to Checkout to complete the payment process. Here are the steps needed to start the integration.

## Integration {{ id: "checkout-integration" }}

The following diagram describes visually and in more detail the life cycle of a payment session in Checkout.

## Sessions States {{ id: "checkout-states-session" }}

Payment sessions can go through various states, each with its own meaning and sequence of changes. Below, we present the possible states in payment sessions and how they relate to each other:
  
- **PENDING:**   
This state indicates that the payment session is pending some action or transaction but has not been completed yet. There may be pending transactions, such as user identity validation or payment approval. You should wait for these pending actions to be resolved before determining whether the session has been successfully completed or if there has been any issue.

- **PARTIAL APPROVED:**   
If a payment transaction has been partially approved, it means that one part has been successfully completed, but another part is still pending or has failed, and the session enters this state.

- **REJECTED:**   
This state can occur when the session is rejected by the user, which can happen when the user decides to cancel the payment. It can also occur when the session expires due to a time limit, indicating that the transaction was not completed in time.

- **PARTIAL EXPIRED:**   
If part of the payment has been approved, but the session has expired before it is fully completed, this state only occurs in partial payment type sessions.

- **APPROVED:**   
This state occurs when payment transactions have been approved, and the session has been successfully completed. Once the process is finished, your [Webhook](/en/checkout/notification) is called.

### Start Checkout

**Create a payment session**  
To accept a payment through Checkout, it is necessary to create a payment session (**Checkout Session**) using the method [API - Create session (CreateRequest)](/en/checkout/api-reference/session#crear-una-sesion).  
Calling this service will return the process URL (`processURL`) and the request identifier (`requestId`).
You can see more in the section [Create Session](/en/checkout/api-reference/session#crear-una-sesion)

**Registration of Payment in Process**  
In your system, create a record that relates the payment in progress to the `requestID` provided.  
The initial status of all payments is pending (`PENDING`).

**User Redirection**  
The user should be redirected to the process URL (`processURL`) provided by PlacetoPay Checkout.

**Payment or Subscription Process**  
In the Checkout interface, the user will complete the payment or subscription process. Checkout will take care of collecting all the necessary data.

**Redirection back to the merchant site**  
Once the checkout process is complete, the user can be redirected back to the return URL (`returnUrl`) specified in the initial request (`CreateRequest`).

At this point it is likely that the payment process has finished. To know the status of the payment you must wait for the notification or check the status of the session.

### Asynchronous notification

When a session has a final status, PlacetoPay will send an asynchronous notification to your site informing you of the completion of the payment process. Be sure to properly handle this notification to maintain data integrity.

### Session query

Sessions must be queried in order to complete the lifecycle.

**Query session status**  
When you arrive at the merchant's site, you must check the status of the session. 
This can be achieved using the [API - Query session (getRequestInformation)](/en/checkout/api-reference/session#consultar-una-sesion) method.

**Update and Business Rules**  
According to the final status of the payment obtained, you must execute the corresponding business rules and update the information related to the payment in your system..
