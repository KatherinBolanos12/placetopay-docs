    'Learn how to customize the language of Checkout sessions and interact with the API in your preferred language.'

# Location

The checkout API and interface supports several languages, you can choose in which language you want to interact. {{ className: 'lead' }}

To choose the language you must send the `locale` parameter in the requests you make, this is also the initial language that the session will have.

```json
{
    "locale": "es_CO",
    ...
}
```

The `locale` parameter is a string containing the locale code, for example `es_CO`. It is an optional parameter, if it is not sent or does not comply with the previously described standards, the locale and country of the site that is creating the session will be taken by default.

Examples:

| Locale  |  Language    | Country              |
|:--------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| `es_CO` | Spanish (es) |  Colombia (CO)       |
| `es_EC` | Spanish (es) |  Ecuador  (EC)       |
| `es_PR` | Spanish (es) |  Puerto Rico  (PR)   |
| `en_US` | English  (en) |  United States (US) |

This parameter is made up of the language code according to the standard [ISO 631-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), followed by an underscore `_` and 2 letters corresponding to the country according to the standard [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#C%C3%B3digos_ISO_3166-1).

Currently the languages are supported: Spanish, English, Portuguese and Italian.
