# Create a Session

Session is the term we use to refer to the payment process with which your users interact in Checkout. {{ className: "leading" }}

To create a session you must consume our API according to your needs, learn the details of the API in [API - Create Session](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#create-a-session).

**Authentication** To create a session you must authenticate with our API, learn the details in [Authentication](/en/checkout/authentication)

**Localization** You can choose the language of the session using the parameters of the api, learn the details in [Localization](/en/checkout/localization)

## Basic Payment {{ id: 'basic-payment' }}

A basic payment session is a session in which you expect to receive a single payment from a user.

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Simple' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        "reference": "PAY_ABC_1287",
        "description": "Payment by Placetopay",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 1000
        },
    }
    ...
}
```

---

## Partial payment {{ id: 'partial-payment' }}

A partial payment session is a session in which a user can make several transactions of different amounts or with different payment methods until the total requested in the same session is completed.

To use this functionality, the `payment.allowPartial` property must be sent as `true`.

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Partial Payment' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        "reference": "PAY_ABC_1287",
        "description": "Payment by Placetopay",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 1000
        },
        "allowPartial": true
    }
    ...
}
```

When a partial payment session is made, new scenarios appear that must be controlled:

- The session ends with the `APPROVED PARTIAL` status, it occurs when at least one `APPROVED` transaction was made in the session, but the total requested amount was not completed.
- The session ends with the `PARTIAL_EXPIRED` status, it occurs when at least one `APPROVED` transaction was made in the session, but the total amount requested was not completed and the session expired.

Partial sessions also have additional conditions such as:

- Taxes are not accepted, since taxes cannot be divided into different transactions.

---

## Recurring payment {{ id: 'recurring-payment' }}

A recurring payment session is a session in which the user completes the process with a credit card, and from that moment on, automatic charges are periodically made to the payment method. For example, in the payment of a monthly payment or subscription to a service.

To use this functionality, the `payment.recurring` property must be sent with the `Recurrence` structure..

 
```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Recurring Payment' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        "reference": "PAY_ABC_1287",
        "description": "Payment by Placetopay",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 1000
        },
        "recurring": {
            "periodicity": "D",
            "interval": "1",
            "nextPayment": "2024-08-24",
            "maxPeriods": 1,
            "dueDate ": "2024-09-24",
            "notificationUrl ": "https://merchanturl.com/notify"
        },
    }
    ...
}
```

- The `nextPayment` attribute is not mandatory, in case it is not sent, it is calculated depending on the `interval` and `periodicity` attribute, in case it is declared it must be a future date to the current date.
- In the case of failing a recurring charge, it will continue to be retried once a day for 3 days, if after this an approved transaction is not obtained, the recurrence is canceled to the cardholder.
- The recurrence is stopped trying if the first response does not make sense to retry (Card invalid, stolen, etc.), that is, it is retried only if it is due to balance.
- Recurrences can only be canceled in the PlacetoPay administrative console.

## Dispersion payment {{ id: 'dispersion-payment' }}

A dispersal session is a session in which the total amount of the payment will be divided into different destinations.

To use this session type, you must pass the `payment.dispersion` property which contains an array of `DispersionRequests`

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Dispersion Payment' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        "reference": "PAY_ABC_1287",
        "description": "Payment by Placetopay",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 1000
        },
        "dispersion": [
            {
                "amount": {
                    "total": 700,
                    "currency": "USD"
                },
                "agreement": 30,
                "agreementType": "AIRLINE"
            },
            {
                "amount": {
                    "total": 300,
                    "currency": "USD"
                },
                "agreementType": "MERCHANT"
            }
        ],
    }
    ...
}
```

The payment can be divided into different registered agreements, it also allows each part of the transaction to be processed by different providers.

To make use of this functionality it is important to know the identifier of the agreement (`agreement`) to which the payment is directed. If no agreement value is added, the payment method configured on the site of the session will be taken by default, it is also necessary to indicate the type of agreement (`aggrementType`), in this case MERCHANT or AIRLINE.

- Partial payments are not allowed when creating a dispersal session.
- No pre-authorization payments are allowed when creating a dispersal session.
- The total sum of the scatters must be equal to the total payout.
- All scatter coins must be equal to the payout currency

For the sending of taxes, it is important that it is in the [amount](/payments/microsite-customized/data-structures#amount) structure of each of the dispersions

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Dispersion Payment Taxes' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        ...
        "dispersion": [
            {
                "amount": {
                    "total": 700,
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "taxes": [
                        {
                            "kind": "airportTax",
                            "amount": 16.13
                        }
                    ],
                    "details": [
                        {
                            "kind": "tip",
                            "amount": 11
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "agreement": 30,
                "agreementType": "AIRLINE",
            },
        ],
    }
    ...
}
```

## Preauthorization payment {{ id: 'preauthorization-payment' }}

This guide explains how to integrate preauthorization payments using Web Checkout. Preauthorization allows merchants to reserve a specific amount on a customer's card without charging it immediately. This reserved amount can later be adjusted, captured, or canceled, providing flexibility for businesses where the final transaction amount may vary.

The preauthorization payment workflow consists of three main steps: Check-in, Reauthorization, and Checkout. Each step plays a crucial role in managing the reserved funds on the customer's card, ensuring flexibility and security throughout the transaction.

- Check-in: The process begins by reserving a specific amount on the customer's card without charging it immediately. This step ensures the availability of funds and creates a reference for subsequent operations.
- Reauthorization: If the transaction amount changes, this step allows merchants to adjust the reserved amount to reflect the updated cost of the service or product.
- Checkout: The final step confirms the transaction by either capturing the reserved amount or releasing it, depending on the final transaction value.

For more information about the Preauthorization payment flow, see [Payments/Preauthorization](/en/payments/preauthorization)

Below, we will explore each step in detail to help you integrate preauthorization payments effectively.

### Step 1: Initiate a preauthorization session (Check-in)

The Check-in step is the first stage of the preauthorization workflow. It creates a hold on the customer's card for a specific amount, acting as a security deposit. This amount is not charged at this stage but ensures that the customer has sufficient funds available for the transaction.

To integrate this step, you must create a Checkout Session. A Checkout Session is a unique URL where the user is redirected to complete the payment process. During this session, the system will generate the "reservation" on the user's card, holding the specified amount without charging it immediately.

This is done by sending the `RedirectRequest` message to the [Create a session endpoint](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#create-a-session). 

```json {{ 'title': 'REQUEST RedirectRequest - Preauthorization Payment' }}
{
    ...
    "type": "checkin",
    "payment": {
        "reference": "PAY_ABC_1287",
        "description": "Payment by Placetopay",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 1000
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

- The `RedirectRequest.action` porperty must be `checkin`. That indicates that the session is for a preauthorization payment and the transaction will be made as a check in transaction.
- Pre-authorization payments are not allowed when you want to make a mixed payment.
- Pre-authorization payments with dispersion values are not allowed.
- The payment currency will also remain the same in **REAUTHORIZATION** and **CHECKOUT**.

Once the session is created, the user must be redirected to `RedirectResponse.processUrl` URL to complete the payment. After the user completes the process, the system will generate a reservation on their card for the specified amount. This reservation will remain in a pending state until further actions, such as Reauthorization or Checkout, are performed.

After the user completes the payment process, the integrator must fetch the session information to determine the payment status and retrieve the data required for subsequent steps. This step is crucial for ensuring that the preauthorization was successful and for obtaining the necessary references for further operations like Reauthorization or Checkout.

To fetch the session information, send the `getRequestInformation` to the [Query a session endpoint](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#query-a-session). This endpoint will return the session details, which contains the internalReference and authorization values needed for the next steps.

```json {{ 'title': 'REQUEST - getRequestInformation - /api/session/:requestId' }}
{
    "auth": {...}, //internal reference code
}
```

```json {{ 'title': 'RESPONSE - RedirectInformation' }}
{
    "requestId": 112233,
    "status": {
        "status": "APPROVED",
        "reason": "00",
        "message": "The request has been successfully approved",
        "date": "2025-05-02T14:43:57-05:00"
    },
    "request": {
        ...
        "payer": {...},
        "payment": {...}
    },
    "payment": [
        {
            ...
            "status": {
                "date": "2025-05-02T14:43:51-05:00",
                "reason": "00",
                "status": "APPROVED",
                "message": "Approved"
            },
            "reference": "CASH_3",
            "authorization": "000000",
            "internalReference": 1599206667,
            ...
        }
    ],
}
```

- The `RedirectInformation.payment.0.internalReference` property, will be the reference reused in subsequent **REAUTHORIZATION** and **CHECKOUT** operations.

Step 2: Modify the Reserved Amount (Reauthorization)

It is applied on pre-authorization transactions and is used to modify the previously reserved amount.

The REAUTHORIZATION type transaction is used to modify the amount defined as previously separated guarantee deposit, with a CHECKIN type transaction. This performs a new authorization by the bank.

- The payment reference is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The payment currency is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The values for `internalReference` and `authorization` must match those provided in the **CHECKIN** response within the `preAuthorization` node.
- Multiple **REAUTHORIZATION** transactions can be performed before **CHECKOUT**.
- Each reauthorization must be for an amount greater than `0`.

After this operation, the pre-authorization remains in a **pending** state until a **CHECKOUT** is performed.

This is done by sending the `TransactionActionRequest` message to the [Transaction actions](/en/checkout/api/reference/payment#transaction-actions). 

```json {{ 'title': 'REQUEST TransactionActionRequest - Reauthorization' }}
{
    ...
    "action": "reauthorization"
    "internalReference": 1, //internal reference code
    "amount": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "total": 100
    },
    ...
}
```

### Checkout

It is applied to pre-authorization transactions and is used to confirm and close the transaction with the indicated amount.

The CHECKOUT type transaction is used to confirm the security deposit amount previously separated, with a CHECKIN/REAUTHORIZATION type transaction. This formalizes the purchase transaction with the bank.

- A **CHECKOUT** can be performed without a prior **REAUTHORIZATION**.
- The payment reference is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The payment currency is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The values for `internalReference` and `authorization` must match those provided in the **CHECKIN** response within the `preAuthorization` node.
- If the **CHECKOUT** amount is `0`, the pre-authorization is canceled, and the retained amount is released.

This is done by sending the `TransactionActionRequest` message to the [Transaction actions](/en/checkout/api/reference/payment#transaction-actions). 

```json {{ 'title': 'REQUEST TransactionActionRequest - Reauthorization' }}
{
    ...
    "action": "checkout"
    "internalReference": 1, //internal reference code
    "amount": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "total": 100
    },
    ...
}
```

With this three-step process, you can safely and effectively handle preauthorized payments using the Gateway API. Always ensure the `internalReference`, `authorization`, and `reference` values are consistent across all steps to avoid transaction errors.

## Subscription {{ id: 'subscription' }}

A subscription session is a session in which the user enters a means of payment to tokenize it and that can then be used to collect on that means of payment.

The subscription allows you to securely store (tokenizing) a user's means of payment, so that you can later make payments related to it.

To make use of this functionality it is necessary to send the `subscription` structure in the `RedirectRequest`.

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Subscription' }}
{
    ...
    "subscription": {
        "reference": "3110",
        "description": "A trial subscription"
    },
    ...
}
```

### Charge on a tokenized means of payment

When a subscription is made, a token is obtained, with this token you can charge the client.

The response structure contains all the information from the original request and a subscription structure (`subscription`) with an instrument (`instrument`) represented as a token.

<Note>
    Double charge protection    
    This endpoint has a security measure that prevents duplicate charges,
    The protection consists of `payment.reference`, `payment.amount.total` y `payment.amount.currency`
    If you send the same payment information within a 24 hour period only one charge will be made.
</Note>

```json {{ 'title': 'CollectRequest' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        "reference": "1122334455",
        "description": "Test",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 100
        }
    },
    "instrument": {
        "token": {
            "token": "e07ca9986cf0ecac8a557fa11c07bf37ea35e9e3e3a4180c49"
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

The token information must be stored on your site and related to the user and/or product. After having the token, you can generate charges to the tokenized payment method using the collect service.

--- 

## Payment with subscription {{ id: 'payment-with-subscription' }}


A payment can be converted into payment and subscription at the same time, to carry out this flow it is important to add the attribute subscribe to true in the payment object as follows

To use this session type, you must set the `payment.subscribe` property to `true`

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest - Payment with Subscription' }}
{
    ...
    "payment": {
        "reference": "PAY_ABC_1287",
        "description": "Payment by Placetopay",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "total": 1000
        },
        "subscribe": true
    }
    ...
}
```

In the payment process, the user can choose if he wants to subscribe to the means of payment.
