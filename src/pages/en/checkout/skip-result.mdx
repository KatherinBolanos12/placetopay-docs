# Skip Result
The Web Checkout API allows skipping or bypassing the summary view of a session with a process in a [final state](/checkout/how-checkout-works#checkout-session-states). This feature is useful if the integration has its own customized session summary view and does not require Web Checkout to display it.

To enable this functionality, the `skipResult` property must be included with the value `true` in the [session creation request](/checkout/create-session). If this property is not sent or is set with a different value, it will default to `false`.

```json
{
    "locale": "es_CO",
    "auth": {...},
    "payment": {...},
    "skipResult": true,
    "expiration": "2021-12-30T00:00:00-05:00",
    "returnUrl": "https://dnetix.co/p2p/client",
    "ipAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "userAgent": "PlacetoPay Sandbox"
}
```

## How Does It Work? {{ id: 'behavior-api' }}
When the session process is completed, the user is redirected to the URL specified in the `returnUrl` property included in the original session creation request without any user interaction.

## How Does It Work Using the Lightbox SDK? {{ id: 'behavior-lightbox' }}
For [Lightbox integrations](/checkout/lightbox#advanced-integration), the `close` event is triggered, and the Lightbox window closes automatically without user interaction.
