# Notification

When a session is terminated, an HTTP (Webhook) notification is sent to the merchant. {{ className: 'lead' }}

To receive notifications you must configure a notification URL in your application. Every time a session ends, an HTTP request will be made to that endpoint with useful information about the session status.

```json {{ 'title': 'Notification' }}
{
  "status": {
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "reason": "00",
    "message": "Approved transaction",
    "date": "2019-01-01T12:00:00-05:00"
  },
  "requestId": 1234,
  "reference": "TEST_123424",
  "signature": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s"
}
```

## Receipt of Notification {{ id: 'notification-reception'}}

To take advantage of this notification, in your application you must:

**Identify the session:** With the `requestId` and `reference` look for the payment in your system, it must match a session that you have previously created.

**Validate message signature:** You can validate that it is a trusted message from Placetopay by generating and comparing the `signature`.

The signature is generated with the following formula: `SHA-1(requestId + status.status + status.date + secretKey)`

If the generated `signature` is equal to the `signature` that arrived in the message, then the notification is authentic.

**Update Information** If all you need is the final state of the session, then you can update the state in your system and that would be it..

Also, if you want to get more information about the session and the related transactions, you should refer to the session and get all the details of it..
