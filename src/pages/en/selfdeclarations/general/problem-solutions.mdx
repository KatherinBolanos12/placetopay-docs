# Troubleshooting
Below are some scenarios that may arise during user registration, primarily situations where an email is sent to the user and they are unable to log in.

1. If the user clicks Complete Registration and is not redirected to the system, it is recommended to copy the URL shown in the image and paste it into their browser to be redirected to the system.

2. If the user has connection issues when selecting the Go to my profile button, they can copy the URL shown in the image into their browser to access it.

3. If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by clicking Forgot your password? on the login screen.

Enter the user's registered email address, click Reset, and the system will send an email to reset the password.

4. If a declaring user loses their electronic key, they can reissue a new one. On the login screen, select the link that says "Lost your electronic key?"

The user must then enter an email address and then select the Request Reissue button to continue with the electronic key reissue process.

A message is immediately sent to the entered email address to confirm the electronic key reissue process. The user can continue by selecting the Reissue Electronic Key button or ignore the message.

The user must then confirm the reissue by completing the information displayed on the form. This will create an electronic key reissue request, which must be approved by a service administrator.

Finally, a message will be generated informing you about the request. Once approved, you will receive an email to reissue your electronic key.

5. When a message is generated that prevents you from completing a declarant's registration:

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/error_message__declarant_record.png"/>
> Oops! Something is wrong, please check your information.

This indicates that some of the information on the form is incorrect. Please note that the authorized user must be associated with the company for the specific return selected on the form. If the user exists but does not have permission for the specific income, they will not be able to complete the process.

6. When an electronic key has already been revoked and the declarant does not receive the email notification to download and configure it again, and the administrator has the Reissue electronic key for user option disabled in the Authorized Users module:

To do this, a system administrator must edit the authorized user who wants to resend the notification, and they must select the Resend notification or Resend link without confrontation button, as appropriate.

7. If you have multiple certificates configured on your computer and the wrong certificate was selected while logging in, you must go to your browser settings to clear your history, cookies, and cache, and restart the browser to access your computer. Otherwise, the system will generate an error message.

<Note>
    It is recommended to use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/new/) to avoid conflicts if you configure more than one certificate on a computer.

8. When you need to make a payment and the declaration has not been authorized for electronic signature because it is not visible, you should contact your system administrator to enable the option.
