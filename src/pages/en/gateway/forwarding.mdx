### Forwarding

Forwarding is a site-level configuration that is necessary when a site has more than one payment method of the same brand (Visa and Mastercard), but with different providers, and it is necessary to define a primary acquirer.

This functionality allows the merchant to determine which provider and acquirer should be used in each transaction with a current credit type, ensuring that there are no conflicts between the different providers available.

This only applies to transactions with Visa, Master cards and current payment credit type.

To request this functionality, please contact us by email at servicioposventa@placetopay.ec

### How to verify if a payment method has the forwarding configured?

When consuming the **information* service, the response will include the **hasForwarding** attribute. If this attribute has a value of `true`, it means that forwarding is configured; otherwise, its value will be `false`.

For the value to be `true`, the following conditions must be met:

- Have at least two providers of the same brand (for example: Visa Interdin and Visa Medianet).
- Have set the routing rules according to the credits to route by the acquirer.
- Current credit type.
- Visa and Mastercard payment methods.

### Forwarding flow with API

```json
    // ...
