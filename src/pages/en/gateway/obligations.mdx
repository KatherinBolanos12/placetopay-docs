# What obligations do I have when using this integration?

Please note that by using this type of integration, you are providing all buyer data including sensitive card data, this fact alone requires that the capture of the information be through a secure mechanism that does not jeopardize the buyer's data. cardholder. If the information is captured by a Web page, the point where this data is captured must be over the secure HTTPS protocol using security certificates issued by an accredited certifying entity.

If the capture is carried out by a Call Center, the person who obtains the sensitive data must be an IVR `Interactive Voice Response` or audio response mechanism; This would imply a break in the process between the process carried out by the operator with his CRM and the IVR who captures the sensitive data. Finally, the CRM consolidates the two sets of data and sends them to Place to Pay.

If the capture comes from a database of previously registered cards, make sure that this information is encrypted by a secure encryption mechanism such as AES or 3DES, decrypt only at the time you construct the frame to be sent to Place to Pay. Place to Pay has tokenization services that can be used.

Please note that as a general rule you should not store the card number, expiration date and CVV2. These can only be persisted during the authorization request, once processed they should not be stored.

Like any integration process, this will require certification from Place to Pay support staff to review functionality, best practices, and usability issues.
