# Gateway integration

## When is better option?

> This mechanism should only be used by those clients of the platform that require capturing cardholder information, including sensitive data.

The integration is recommended only in cases where it is not feasible for the user to carry out the transaction by entering sensitive data in PlacetoPay or where particular control of the operation is required.

Some examples are:

* Recurring charges from a proprietary database.
* Integration with an audio response system.
* Multiple transactions to different collectors with the same cardholder information.
* Proprietary mobile interface, not HTML based.
* Integration with systems whose sensitive data entry is not done directly by the cardholder.
