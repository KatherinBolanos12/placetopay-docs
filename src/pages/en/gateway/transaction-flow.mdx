# Flow of a transaction

This is a process to carry out the transaction that involves the consumption of the services described in this document.

1. Once the user's card number is captured, the consumption is made to the information service `information` by sending it in the request.

2. The service response is analyzed to provide the following options
    * If the response includes credit types, `credits` must be shown to the user to allow them to select which one they want to use.    * Si la respuesta trae el par√°metro `requirePocket` en true, se debe mostrar los bolsillos `pockets` al usuario para permitirle seleccionar cual desea usar.
    * If the response has the `requireAvs` parameter set to true, the user must be required to enter a zip code and validate the entry with the `zipCodeFormat` format.
    * If the response has the `accountVerification` parameter set to true, you must make the consumption to the account verification service and obtain the verified account instrument.
    * If the response has the `displayInterest` parameter set to true, once a type of credit has been selected, it must consume the interest calculation service `interests` and show the user the response, thus every time the user changes type of credit.
    * If the response has the `requireOtp` parameter set to true, the consumption must be made to the OTP generation service (otpGeneration) and obtain from the user the code that will be 6 digits to send it later in the OTP validation service `otp /validate` Once there is a response, the signature result will be sent under the OTP field of the processing request.

3. Once the type of credit (if any), the zip code, the pocket, the verified account, the OTP (if required) have been obtained, the transaction processing service `process` is consumed and the transaction is analyzed. response that can be final approved, declined or failed or that can be pending. In both cases a value will be returned for internalReference which is very important to store because it will allow you to make subsequent queries with the `query` service.
    * If the transaction was approved, it is important to also store the authorization number, it will allow you to make reversals later if necessary.
    * Generally transactions are completed in a short time (less than 3 seconds), but if the transaction remains in a pending state it is important to have a cron job or similar that is consulting every 5 minutes for pending transactions until they are resolved.

4. Generally transactions are completed in a short time (less than 3 seconds), but the following scenarios may occur that must be controlled
    * If the response is pending, you can take the internal reference and consume the query service every 5m until it ends in a final state (APPROVED, REJECTED or FAILED).
    * If there was a failure in the network or in the service and there is no response from the `process` service, it is necessary to consume the `search` service with the reference and amount sent until this service confirms or that found the transaction or that it could not be carried out due to the connection error.
