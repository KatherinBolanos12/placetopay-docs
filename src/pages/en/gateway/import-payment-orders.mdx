# Exchange files for invoice collection

## Introduction

By using PlacetoPay you can enable collection with all payment methods available in Colombia as well obviates the integration or development processes with the different networks.

## Defining swap files

These files contain the list of invoices or collections authorized to be collected through PlacetoPay.

These formats allow the information to be consulted when the collection is made regardless of the medium (Internet, audio response system or point of care).

## Billing file [Asobancaria 2001 Format]

The format for uploading information for collection is described below. This format is based on the 2001 Asobancaria specification with some modifications using the fill field.

As a general rule, files are of fixed length, so for values numeric the value must have leading zero padding to complete the length. While for alphanumeric values, the padding must be with blanks on the right.

The format has the following structure:

```txt
File header registration
    Batch Header Record No. 1
    Detail record 1
    ....
    Detail record n
    Batch control record No. 1
    Batch Header Record No. n
    Detail record 1
    ....
    Detail record n
    Batch control record No. n
File control record
```

The length of each record is 220 characters and its content is specified below:

## Billing File [CSV-Proprietary Format]

This format was born from the requirement of our clients to facilitate the uploading of invoices, in a more intuitive mechanism that can be easily adjusted to the size of the company that wishes to upload it, without involving greater efforts and with the possibility of using a spreadsheet. as a generation engine.

The file itself contains the basic fields used by the platform for the invoice payment process.

As a general rule, the file is of variable length, using the comma (,) as a field separator and the double quote as a field delimiter for character strings. In cases where a field does not have a value, it must be left blank (,,). When you need to establish a decimal number for a numerical value, you must use the period. A possible variation to this format is to use the semicolon (;) to separate the fields and the comma (,) for decimal figures. Please note that the order of the fields is strict.

The format has the following structure:

```txt
File control record
    Detail record 1
    ….
    Detail record n
```

## Billing File [ UBL-Invoice 1.0 Format ]

Since its adoption as a W3C recommendation in 1998, XML has been adopted in a number of industries as a framework for defining message exchanges in electronic commerce. The widespread use of XML has led to the development of multiple XML versions of basic documents, such as purchase orders, shipping notes, and invoices.

Although the use of specific formats for each industry or need has the advantage of maximum optimization for the business context, the existence of different formats to achieve the same purpose in different business areas generates a series of disadvantages.

The OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) is intended to help solve these problems by defining a generic XML interchange format for business documents that can be extended to meet the needs of certain industries.

PlacetoPay uses the proposed OASIS model in its implementation of UBL-Invoice in version 1.0.
