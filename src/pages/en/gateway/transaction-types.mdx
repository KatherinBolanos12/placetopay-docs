## Dispersion

This type of transaction is used to split the payment between different entities besides the main site. That is, when making a transaction, part of the value is directed to the site authenticated in the transaction, and another part is sent to an airline or other sites. Additionally, this allows each part of the transaction to be processed by different providers.

The dispersal transaction is made up of a parent session of type `DISPERSION` that contains the total value of the transaction and the general state of the process, and also by daughter sessions of type `AUTH_ONLY` that contain the information of each of the parties. scattered. The authorization and receipt data of the parent transaction will be the same as the first transaction processed.

In the event that a transaction remains pending, the other pending transactions will not be processed until it is resolved, leaving a status of `PENDING_PROCESS`. The parent transaction will maintain its `PENDING` state until all child sessions are resolved.

In the event that a transaction fails or is rejected, other pending transactions will automatically be rejected as well, without establishing contact with the network. If a child transaction has already been approved previously, it maintains its state and the parent transaction will change its state to `APPROVED_PARTIAL`.

Transactions can be reversed together or separately. If a rollback is sent to a child transaction, only the child transaction will be rolled back. If a rollback is sent to the parent transaction, all transactions will be rolled back.

### Airline dispersion

When a dispersal is made to an airline, it will be prioritized and processed first. If 3DS or credit is configured, this configuration will be used only in processing the airline transaction.

Airline dispersions are limited to just two parties: one from the main business and one from the airline. It is also possible to perform a spread in which the total value of the transaction is redirected to the airline, by not sending the trade spread or sending it with a zero value.

### Business dispersion

Merchant spreads allow a split transaction to be made across up to 3 sites, including the authenticated site. Child transactions will be processed in the order sent in the transaction.
