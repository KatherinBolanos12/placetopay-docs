# API Version Policy

At Placetopay we have only one version of the api available to date. So if you are going to connect or are already connected to our api, you are using the only version available. {{ className: 'lead' }}

As it is a single API version, all new features and adjustments are made in the same API version and are intended to be **backward-compatible**.

## Backward Compatible Changes {{ id: 'backwards-compatible-changes' }}

At Placetopay we consider the following changes backward compatible:

### Add new resources and endpoints.

When a new functionality is added, it is very likely that it will be accompanied by a new endpoint and/or resource.

**Example:** If a new API was released to get users, the functionality would lead to a new `User` resource and a new `api.com/users` endpoint.   

### Add new optional parameters to existing API requests

Due to the evolution of some functionalities, it is possible that we will add new **optional** parameters in the requests that can be made by integrator clients.

**Example:** In the `CreateRequest` api, an **optional** `notificationUrl` parameter could be added for those integrator clients who want to define the notification url of that session.

```json
// CreateRequest body

{
  ...
  "payment": { ... }
  "notificationUrl": "http://example.com" // new optional parameter
  ...
}
```

This new parameter will be **optional** and will not affect existing integrations.

### Add new properties to existing API responses

Due to the evolution of some functionalities, it is possible that some api responses include new properties.

**Example:** In the `GetRequestInformation` api the response can be modified to include a new `cancelled` property inside the `subscription` property

```json
// GetRequestInformation Response
{
  ...
  "subscription": {
    ...
    "cancelled": true, // new property
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

This new property will be included and will not affect existing integrations.

### Change the order of properties in existing API responses

Due to the evolution of some functionalities, it is probable that some api responses will change the order of their properties.

**Example:** In the `GetRequestInformation` api the response can be modified so that the order of the properties is different.

```json
// current
{
  "requestId": "123",
  "status": { ... },
  ...
}

// changes to
{
  "status": { ... }, // changed order
  "requestId": "123",
  ...
}
```

This change will not affect existing integrations.

### Change required parameters to optional in existing API requests

Due to the evolution of some functionality, we may change an existing parameter that is required to **optional** in requests that can be made by integrator clients.

**Example:** In the `CreateRequest` api the required parameter `ipAddress` could be changed to be **optional**.


```json
// CreateRequest body

{
  ...
  "payment": { ... }
  "ipAddress": "1.0.0.0.1" // changed to be optional
  ...
}
```

This change will not affect existing integrations.

The opposite cannot be done, that is, an optional parameter cannot be returned **required**.
