# Notification

We have a notification system that allows merchants to receive notifications through a URL they configure themselves. Notifications are sent in JSON format and contain information about the event that has occurred on the associated link, allowing merchants to take necessary actions automatically. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Types of Notifications {{ id: 'events-notify' }}

There are several events that can trigger notifications, including:

- **PAID:** Sent when a payment associated with the link has been completed with an ``Approved`` status. We handle this notification so that the merchant is aware that they can now check the link to verify the payment and release the associated product or service.
    ```json
    {
        "status": {
            "status": "PAID",
            "reason": 200,
            "message": "You have a transaction in approved status",
            "date": "2024-06-25T00:43:21-05:00"
        },
        "linkId": 2,
        "reference": "#5321",
        "signature": "e1ab3b5d25dd2c81c3386a2e4c3a2818911e5d09f012005c21f8e20c6e0d5ab6"
    }
    ```

- **EXPIRED:** Sent when a payment link has expired. It is important for the merchant to know that their payment link will no longer receive payments and take actions accordingly, such as generating a new payment link.
    ```json
    {
        "status": {
            "status": "EXPIRED",
            "reason": 200,
            "message": "The link has expired.",
            "date": "2024-06-25T00:53:36-05:00"
        },
        "linkId": 2,
        "reference": "#5321",
        "signature": "a02e7afa8f8313ccaa29edf056bc95a243671ec5e995c0dac5953c17f8bc529f"
    }
    ```

Although these are the most common events, it is possible that more events triggering notifications will be added in the future.

## Notification Security

To ensure the security of notifications, each notification includes a digital signature that allows the merchant to verify the authenticity of the notification. The signature is generated from the notification information and the merchant's ``secretKey``.

The signature is sent in the `signature` field of the notification. To verify the signature, the merchant must follow these steps:

1. Concatenate the values of the notification fields in the following order: `linkId`, `status`, `date`, ``secretKey``.
2. Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the resulting string.
3. Compare the generated signature with the signature received in the notification.

Here is an example of what the signature verification process would look like in a programming language:

<CodeGroup title="Compare signature">

```php
$secretKey = "mySiteSecretKey";

$notification = [
    "status" => [
        "status" => "PAID",
        "reason" => 200,
        "message" => "You have a transaction in approved status",
        "date" => "2024-06-25T00:43:21-05:00"
    ],
    "linkId" => 2,
    "reference" => "#5321",
    "signature" => "e1ab3b5d25dd2c81c3386a2e4c3a2818911e5d09f012005c21f8e20c6e0d5ab6"
];

$string = sprintf(
    '%s%s%s%s',
    $notification['linkId'],
    $notification['status']['status'],
    $notification['status']['date'],
    $secretKey
);

$signature = hash('sha256', $string);

if ($signature === $notification['signature']) {
    // The notification is authentic
} else {
    // The notification is not authentic
}
```

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');

const secretKey = "mySiteSecretKey";

const notification = {
    status: {
        status: "PAID",
        reason: 200,
        message: "You have a transaction in approved status",
        date: "2024-06-25T00:43:21-05:00"
    },
    linkId: 2,
    reference: "#5321",
    signature: "e1ab3b5d25dd2c81c3386a2e4c3a2818911e5d09f012005c21f8e20c6e0d5ab6"
};

const string = `${notification.linkId}${notification.status.status}${notification.status.date}${secretKey}`;

const signature = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(string).digest('hex');

if (signature === notification.signature) {
    // The notification is authentic
} else {
    // The notification is not authentic
}
```

``` python
import hashlib

secret_key = "mySiteSecretKey"

notification = {
    "status": {
        "status": "PAID",
        "reason": 200,
        "message": "You have a transaction in approved status",
        "date": "2024-06-25T00:43:21-05:00"
    },
    "linkId": 2,
    "reference": "#5321",
    "signature": "e1ab3b5d25dd2c81c3386a2e4c3a2818911e5d09f012005c21f8e20c6e0d5ab6"
}

string = f"{notification['linkId']}{notification['status']['status']}{notification['status']['date']}{secret_key}"

signature = hashlib.sha256(string.encode()).hexdigest()

if signature == notification['signature']:
    # The notification is authentic
    pass
else:
    # The notification is not authentic
    pass
```

</CodeGroup>

If the signatures match, the notification is authentic and the merchant can trust the information received. Otherwise, the notification is not authentic, and the merchant should ignore it.

<Note>
  It is important that the merchant keeps their ``secretKey`` secure and does not share it with third parties. The ``secretKey`` is necessary to verify the authenticity of notifications and protect the integrity of the data.
