# How does Payment Link work?

The Payment Link service allows merchants to quickly and easily create personalized payment links. These links can be shared with customers through various channels (email, social media, etc.), facilitating the payment process. Below is a detailed description of the workflow from link creation to payment confirmation.

## Workflow Description
1. **Payment Link Creation:** The interested merchant uses the Payment Link API to create a new payment link, specifying details such as name, amount, description, and optionally, an expiration date.
2. **Temporary Link Generation:** The API generates a temporary link on the "MICROSITIOS" platform that contains all the payment information. This link is unique and is associated with the newly created payment link.
3. **Access to the Link:** If the link creation is successful, the user is provided with the temporary link, which is a unique URL. The user can access this URL using their web browser.
4. **Payment Information:** Upon opening the link, the user sees all relevant payment information, such as the name of the purchase, the amount to be paid, and a detailed description. Additionally, a "Pay" button is presented.
5. **Redirection to WebCheckout:** If the user decides to proceed with the payment, they click the "Pay" button. At that moment, they are automatically redirected to a "WebCheckout" session.
6. **Secure Payment Process:** In "WebCheckout," the user completes the payment process securely. All payment-related information, such as the amount and description, is automatically loaded into the payment process so the user can make the transaction efficiently and accurately.
7. **Payment Confirmation:** After successfully completing the payment, the user receives a confirmation and a receipt of the transaction. Simultaneously, the status of the payment link on the "MICROSITIOS" platform is updated to reflect the completed payment.
