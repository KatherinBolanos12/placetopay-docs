# Localization

You can also customize the language of the payment links, deciding in which language the payment link will be sent and displayed to the user {{ className: 'lead' }}

To choose the language, you must send the `locale` parameter in the requests you make; this will also be the initial language for the session.

```json
{
    "locale": "es_CO",
    ...
}
```

The locale parameter is a string that contains the localization code, for example, es_CO. It is an optional parameter, and if it is not sent or does not meet the previously described standards, the default locale and country of the site creating the link will be used.
Ejemplos:

| Locale  |  Idioma      | Pa√≠s                 |
|:--------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| `es_CO` | Spanish (es) |  Colombia (CO)       |
| `es_EC` | Spanish (es) |  Ecuador  (EC)       |
| `es_PR` | Spanish (es) |  Puerto Rico (PR)    |
| `en_US` | English (en) |  United States (US)  |

This parameter is composed of the language code according to the ISO 639-1 standard, followed by an underscore _ and 2 letters corresponding to the country according to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard.

Currently supported languages are: Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Italian.
