# Introduction to Microsites

Microsites are an ideal solution for selling and collecting online without the need for a full website. These sites allow for detailed branding and facilitate direct interaction with your customers.

With our microsites, you can offer your customers a simple and effective platform for making payments for taxes, services, insurance, travel, subscriptions, memberships, donations, and more.

Additionally, we provide a robust API for creating microsites, whether open or closed. This allows you to adjust payment settings to the specific needs of your business.

Explore our [Microsite API](/en/microsites/api/reference/microsites) to learn more and start integrating this powerful tool into your online sales and collection strategy.
