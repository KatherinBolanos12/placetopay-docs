Next, the following general fields of a payment link will be displayed, which must be completed as follows:

**Link to:** In this field, you must select whether the payment link will be associated to a site or a microsite. Always choose the **Site** option.

<Note> In case you have any special configuration, it must be associated to a microsite. </Note>

**Site:** Select the name of the site to which you want to link the payment link. In this case, only the sites associated with the merchant will be displayed.

**Name:** Enter the name under which the payment link will appear in the history of links created. This will also be the name under which the payment link will be shared.

**Number of payments allowed:** In this field, you can specify the number of approved payments that will be allowed through the payment link. **If left empty, the approved payments will be unlimited until the expiration date is reached.

**Payment process expiration time:** This field defines the time limit, in **minutes**, for the payment process to expire. The count starts when the user clicks on the payment link and starts the transactional flow in Checkout. It is recommended to set a range of **10 to 15 minutes** to ensure a smooth experience.

**Expiration Date:** This field sets the expiration date of the payment link. Once this date is reached, the link will be disabled and cannot be used.
