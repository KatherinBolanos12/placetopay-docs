# Export Transactions

Through the Placetopay admin console, users from our partner merchants and company collaborators have the option to export transactions using specific filters or queries. This allows exporting bulk transaction data either as an XML (Excel file) or a CSV (plain text file separated by commas).

Below is a step-by-step guide to exporting transactions.

Access the admin console and click on the **Transactions** module.

Navigate to the **Generate Reports** section.
