## Transactions Module
When entering the Transactions module, you'll find a quick search filter that allows you to locate a transaction using:

- The transaction reference.
- The email address of the user who made the purchase

If you don't have this information, you can access the FILTER section, where you'll find various search methods to locate the transaction, such as:

This tool offers different types of reports depending on the client's needs.
As a payment gateway, we recommend the **General Summary**, as it is the most comprehensive and provides a full overview of the transactions.

You can select different types of data to view transaction behavior:

- **Start date and end date:** Time range for analyzing the transactions.
- **Period:** Filter by day, month, quarter, year, time of day, or day of the week.
- **Airline:** Only applies to transactions related to airlines; otherwise, leave this field empty.
- **Response:** Filter by a specific response type (approved, rejected, declined, etc.). Leave empty to include all.
- **Merchant:** Specify the merchant name to which the transaction belongs.
- **Site:** Select the site from which you want to generate the report.
- **Currency:** Useful if you operate transactions in multiple currencies.

Once all values are defined, simply click the **Generate** button to produce the report.
