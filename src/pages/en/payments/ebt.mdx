<PageTitle title='EBT' imageSrc={ebt} />

Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) is an electronic system that allows a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participant to pay for food using SNAP benefits. When a participant shops at a SNAP authorized retail store, their SNAP EBT account is debited to reimburse the store for food that was purchased.

## Payment Flow  
1. The user selects EBT as the payment method at checkout.  
2. Enters their EBT card details.  
3. Completes the OTP (one-time password) validation.
4. Placetopay processes the transaction and notifies both the merchant and the user about the transaction status.

## Webcheckout Integration  

The EBT payment method is now available and ready to use through [Webcheckout](/checkout). Placetopay securely and automatically manages the entire payment process, ensuring a seamless user experience.  
At the end of each transaction, the user will receive a voucher with the transaction details, including the updated balance of their EBT account.
