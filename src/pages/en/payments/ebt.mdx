Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) is an electronic system that allows a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participant to pay for food using SNAP benefits. When a participant shops at a SNAP authorized retail store, their SNAP EBT account is debited to reimburse the store for food that was purchased.

## Payment Flow  
1. The user selects EBT as the payment method at checkout.  
2. The user enters their EBT card details.  
3. Placetopay processes the transaction and notifies both the merchant and the user about the transaction status.
