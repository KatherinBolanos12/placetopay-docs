# Introduction


Welcome to our Merchant Orientation Module. This documentation provides a complete guide for the consultation and management of transactions in the main processing networks in Colombia. Here you will find key processes for validations, incident resolution and clearing, optimizing response times and after-sales service.

Aimed at administrators and support teams, it includes detailed instructions on queries, requests, reversals and clearing, as well as frequently asked questions and key contacts. Our goal is to provide you with clear and accessible information so that you can manage electronic payments efficiently and be prepared for any after-sales service adjustments.
