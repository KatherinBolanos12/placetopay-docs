# Credibanco
Processing network in charge of processing the franchises **Visa, American Express, Diners.

## Final status inquiry

For the Credibanco network at the moment of making a transaction consultation to confirm/know its final status when it is declined or failed in the gateway, we have two ways to make the consultation via e-mail or through the atrecom application (consult atrecom manual).

### E-mail
soporte.ventanopresente@credibanco.com

By means of the previously indicated e-mail, it will be possible to escalate consultations with respect to terminals, transactions, reversals and from the processing network we will obtain the respective answers and supports that correspond.
The information that must be sent initially to make the consultation can be found in the administrative panel of Placetopay, directing us to the transaction that we want to validate.

The data required for these queries can be found in the administrative panel in the section “Transaction Data”. The data required are Date, Internal Reference, Card Bin (first 6 digits) or its last 4 digits, Franchise, Unique Code, Terminal Number, Authorization/CUS, Receipt, total value as previously mentioned, these will be found in the Placetopay administrative panel:

<Note>In yellow we can see the first 6 digits of the BIN and in blue the last 4 digits.</Note>

In case the CUS is 0000 and the receipt omits this data.

Subsequently, by means of the same e-mail we will receive the respective answer, and the supports of the compensation.

## Compensation consultation

Before the Credibanco processing network, the consultation and questions regarding the compensation of transactions must be made through the Atrecom application.

<a href="https://transfer.credibanco.com/form/atrecom" target="_blank" rel="URL Atrecom">URL Atrecom</a>

Once we access the url we will find important information, after reading it we will proceed to click next:

<CenteredContainer>
    <ImageZoom
      src="/payments/processing_networks/atrecom_homepage.webp"
      alt="atrecom_homepage_rd"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
    />
</CenteredContainer>

In the following form we will proceed to fill in the required fields and select option 4. I want to validate the status of a transaction and click on continue:

    />
</CenteredContainer>

This will take us to a form where we will download the template file by clicking on download file which is highlighted in yellow.

    />
</CenteredContainer>



Once we have downloaded the form we will proceed to fill in the information regarding the transaction we are going to consult, remember that this information can be found in the **Transaction Data** section in the administrative panel.

    />
</CenteredContainer>

Afterwards, we will obtain a ticket number with atrecom through which we will be able to consult the status or reply in case we are not satisfied with the answer received, so it is important to save this ticket number.

<CenteredContainer>

    />
</CenteredContainer>

Likewise, this will be sent via e-mail to the e-mail address indicated at the beginning of the form and the response to the request will be sent to the same e-mail address.

## Untimely reversals
An untimely reversal is the return of a payment made outside the deadline established for intraday reversals, ie, 
any return made after the same day of transaction processing. 
When it is necessary to return the money to the cardholder, the merchant must request an adjustment to reimburse the total or partial value of the purchase.

This process applies to Visa, Diners and American Express transactions.
You must enter <a href="https://transfer.credibanco.com/form/atrecom" target="_blank" rel="URL Atrecom">URL Atrecom</a> with mailing address, unique code and NIT.
