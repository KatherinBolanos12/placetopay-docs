## Atrecom does not let me access with the form data (Credibanco)

Generally, this happens due to a typing error in the unique code and/or NIT of the business.
In case of reviewing and finding the data correctly typed, you must communicate with Credibanco through its customer service channels to validate that the unique code of the establishment is active.

it is necessary to write the message without punctuation or special characters, since the platform does not support them and we will not be able to continue with the request.

we must evaluate which franchise it refers to, since Credibanco only validates Visa and American Express and Redeban MasterCard transactions.
