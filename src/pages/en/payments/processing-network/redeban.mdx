## Final status query

For the Redeban network at the moment of making a transaction consultation to confirm/know its final status when it is declined or failed in the gateway, we will be able to make the consultation via e-mail through the mailbox: servicio.cliente@rbm.com.co and soportepasarelas@rbm.com.co.

By means of the previously indicated e-mail, it will be possible to escalate consultations with respect to terminals, transactions and from the processing network we will obtain the respective answers and supports that correspond.

The information that must be sent initially to make the query can be found in the placetopay administrative panel, directing us to the transaction we wish to validate.

The data required for these queries can be found in the administrative panel in the **Transaction Data** section. The data required are Date, Internal Reference, Card Bin (first 6 digits) or its last 4 digits, Franchise, Unique Code, Terminal Number, Authorization/CUS, Receipt, Total Value as previously mentioned, these will be found in the placetopay administrative panel:

<Note> In yellow we can see the first 6 digits of the BIN and in blue the last 4 digits. </Note>

In case the CUS/receipt is in 0000 and the receipt is omitted.

## Untimely Reversal
An untimely reversal is the return of a payment made after the deadline established for intraday reversals, that is, any return made after the same day of transactional processing. When it is necessary to return the money to the cardholder, the merchant must request an adjustment that reimburses the total or partial value of the purchase.

This process applies to transactions made with the MasterCard franchise.
1.	You must enter <a href="https://www.portalcomerciosredeban.com/" target="_blank" rel="URL Atrecom">Business Portal Redeban</a> with the assigned email, NIT and password. With the **operator** profile you will be able to make the transaction adjustment request through the page.

2. If your profile is **operator**, the **Settings Request** module will be enabled and you will be able to start registering the settings.

- Enter the VAT or INC of the adjustment value (if you don't know it enter 0).
