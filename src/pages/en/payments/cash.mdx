## Payment Method Behavior

- **Integrations through**: [Webcheckout](/en/checkout)  
  Once users complete the payment form, they will be able to download a PDF with the necessary details to make the payment at authorized points. In addition, the document will also be sent to their email.

## Restrictions

- **Expiration Date**: The value for the `expiration` field must be at least **30 minutes** after the time of [creating the session](/checkout/api/reference/session#create-a-session) with the Cash payment method.

  This condition is also verified at the time of generating the pdf to ensure payment processing.
