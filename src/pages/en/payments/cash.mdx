## Payment Method Behavior

- **Integrations through**: [Webcheckout](/en/checkout)  
  Once users complete the payment form, they will be able to download a PDF with the necessary details to make the payment at authorized points. In addition, the document will also be sent to their email.

  Upon payment, the status of the session will be updated within 5 to 10 minutes.

## Restrictions

- **Expiration Date**: The value for the `expiration` field must be at least **30 minutes** after the time of [creating the session](/checkout/api/reference/session#create-a-session) with the Cash payment method.

  This condition is also verified at the time of generating the pdf to ensure payment processing.
