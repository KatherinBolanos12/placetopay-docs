## ¿How to Consult a Payment Order?

<p>To consult a payment order, you have two options. The first option allows for a quick search.</p>

      src="/searche_order.webp"
      alt="quick search example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110"

</CenteredContainer>

<p>Another way to search for transactions is by using the filter option.</p>

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/filter_order.webp"
      alt="filter option example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110"
