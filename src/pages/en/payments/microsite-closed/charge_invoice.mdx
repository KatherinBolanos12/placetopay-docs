### Considerations:

- Have a username and password to access the administrative console: [Placetopay Admin Panel](https://panel.placetopay.com/index.php/module/Sites/action/Index) {{ className: 'lead' }}

2. Enter the requested information in the form:

      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110"

</CenteredContainer>

You can delete a payment order individually by clicking on the payment order number.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/number_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

After accessing the payment order, you will have the option to delete it.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/delete_order_payment.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

<Note type="error">To delete a payment order, no transactional processes should have been registered for it. </Note>

## How to query a payment order?

You have two options for querying a payment order. The first option is a section that allows for a quick search.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/searche_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Here, you can perform a quick search using the payment order number or the alternate reference to locate the specific order you are looking for.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/search_order_payment.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Another way to search for transactions is through the filter option.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/filter_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

This allows for more advanced searches with multiple filter options.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/filter_field_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

After selecting the search parameters, you need to add each condition for the filter.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/add_condition.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Then, apply the filter.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/apply_filter.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Once applied, you will see the payment orders matching your selected parameters.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/apply_filter_order_number.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Additionally, you can save filters if you frequently search with the same criteria. To do this, click on the Save Filter option.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/save_filter.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

You will be prompted to name the filter, assign it, and click the Ok button.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/save_filter_one.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

This will be visible in the saved filters section, and you can apply it by clicking on it and selecting the Apply Filter option.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/save_filter_two.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>
